# Iceium :ice_cream:
With rising climate change and hotter weather throughout the world this summer, staying cool is more important than ever to prevent potential heat stroke and have a good time out doors. This summer 2022 in a study of 246 U.S. locations, 53% of those locations saw a rise in their average temperature by 2°F or more. Our team was motivated to find a positive and fun solution to combatting the rising heat levels through an interactive platform, accessible to all users.

## Inspiration 	:star2:

With rising climate change and hotter weather throughout the world this summer, staying cool is more important than ever to prevent potential heat stroke and have a good time out doors. This summer 2022 in a study of 246 U.S. locations, 53% of those locations saw a rise in their average temperature by 2°F or more. Our team was motivated to find a positive and fun solution to combatting the rising heat levels through an interactive platform, accessible to all users.

## What it does :mag:
The Iceium website is designed to find the nearest local ice cream shops and grocery stores to an inputted location. Using the Google Maps API, users can easily find these locations through our website and choose which delicious ice cream stores to go to. Iceium is a easy to access and provides useful resources for any user to find a quick bite of ice cream
## What we used
To create this website, we used a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Google Maps API.

## Challenges we ran into :bangbang:
While creating this website, we struggled to implement the use of an API that would allow for user input. While first using the Yelp Fusion API, we struggled with authorization at first, but later managed to fix the issue. Through messing with the Fusion API, we figured out that it didn't allow for user input so we quickly switched to the Google Maps API, which we ultimately ended up using. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of :trophy:
Some accomplishments we're proud of are using the Google Cloud Platform to load a map based on the user's current location when they click on the 'Shops' or 'Grocery' tabs, prompting the Maps API to show ice cream shops around them. 
## What we learned :book:
In creating this project, we learned how to use HTML and CSS together to create a website that not only looks good but also performs functionally. We also learned how to properly integrate the Maps API onto our website using Javascript and HTML.
## What's next for Iceium :shaved_ice:
Our team is looking to expanding the functions of this website potentially allowing users to have more options within the website to find their favorite ice cream shops.
